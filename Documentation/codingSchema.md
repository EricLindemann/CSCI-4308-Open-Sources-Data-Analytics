#We have decided on the following naming conventions in our code:
#
---
---
#
#Classes:
##All of our classes have names that have a capital letter at the beginning of each word.
##Ex. SimpleClass(a, b)
##Ex. StreamListener(1, 2, 'Hello World')
---
#Variables:
##Our variables bear all lower case letters, with an underscore seperating each word.
##Ex. sample_variable = 1
##Ex. total_tweet_count = 587
