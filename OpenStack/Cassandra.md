##To look at all of the tweet ids of all of the tweets for Trump, you would use the command:
---

---
##IF I just want to look at the text fields from tweets about Trump, you would use the command:
---
###SELECT tweet from trump;
---
#3. Useful Cassandra Commands:

##1. Use a keyspace
###   USE name_of_keyspace;
